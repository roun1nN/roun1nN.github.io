Another day, another battle in your honor and I'm branded black and blue.

Another escalated argument to follow and it always starts with you.

The truth may be that everything's divisible by you and me

but adding us together equals hearts breaking.

Opposites attract and that's the truth, oh.

Here we're standing on the pinnacle.

We're shoulder to shoulder

but colder than we've ever been.

We're just floating with our face down.

I wonder if we'll escape before the storm comes in.

So starting over is the hardest call,

but trust me in the end it will be worth the fall.

'Cause I'm sick of standing on the pinnacle with you.

Three little words but if repeated without meaning they can really start to burn.

But we're comfortably numb,

we're so young, we're so dumb

so I guess we'll never learn.

The truth may be that everything's divisible by you and me.

Adding us together equals hearts breaking.

Opposites attract, that's me and you, oh.

Here we're standing on the pinnacle.

We're shoulder to shoulder

but colder than we've ever been.

We're just floating with our face down.

I wonder if we'll escape before the storm comes in.

So starting over is the hardest call,

but trust me in the end it will be worth the fall.

'Cause I'm sick of standing on the pinnacle with you.

Take me home before our sins unfold.

Our days I know are numbered.

Let me go before I'm grey and old.

Our hearts we're meant to slumber.

(Here we're standing on the pinnacle.)

Here we're standing on the pinnacle.

We're shoulder to shoulder

but colder than we've ever been.

We're just floating with our face down.

I wonder if we'll escape before the storm comes in.

So starting over is the hardest call,

but trust me in the end it will be worth the fall.

'Cause I'm sick of standing on the pinnacle with you.
