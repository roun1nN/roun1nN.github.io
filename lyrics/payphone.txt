I'm at a payphone trying to call home
我在公共电话前试着打回家...
All of my change I spent on you
我所有的钱都花在你身上
Where have the times gone
过去的时光跑哪去了
Baby it's all wrong,
宝贝一切都走样了
Where are the plans we made for two?
属于我们的未来呢?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
我知道这很难想起
The people we used to be
过去的我们
It's even harder to picture
甚至更难去想象
That you're not here next to me
你已不在我身边
You said it's too late to make it
你说已经为时已晚
But is it too late to try?
是不是也太难挽回?
And in our time that you wasted
你浪费了我们的时光
All of our bridges burned down
我们之间的桥梁被破坏了
I've wasted my nights
我虚度了我的夜晚
You turned out the lights
你将我的光明熄灭了
Now I'm paralyzed
而我还痴痴地
Still stuck in that time
还停留在那时
When we called it love
我们相恋的时候
But even the sun sets in paradise
但就算是天堂.也有日落的时候

If happy ever afters did exist

I would still be holding you like this
我会继续守护着你
All those fairy tales are full of shit
那些童话都是狗屎
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
再来一首情歌,我就快吐了
Oh~You turned your back on tomorrow
你转身逃避了明天
Cause you forgot yesterday
因为你把昨天给遗忘
I gave you my love to borrow
我给了你我的心
But just gave it away
而你却将它遗弃
You can't expect me to be fine

I don't expect you to care
我也不期望你会关心
I know I said it before
我知道我曾经说过
But all of our bridges burnt down
