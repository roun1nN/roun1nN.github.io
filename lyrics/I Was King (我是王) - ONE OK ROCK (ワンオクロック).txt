We said tonight
No going back
Nothing seems right
Stuck in the past
When am I when am I
Gonna start living
When am I when am I
Gonna move on
When am I when am I
Gonna kill this feeling
When am I when am I
Gonna stop this dreaming
When I was king
I was king
We had everything
When am I when am I
Gonna start living
When I was king
I was king
We had everything
When am I when am I
Gonna start living
Don't wanna go
I'm holding on tight
Something to live for
Make it our nights
Shut down the sirens in our heads
When I was king
I was king
We had everything
When am I when am I
Gonna start living
When I was king
I was king
We had everything
When am I when am I
Gonna start living
Yeah I was king
I was king
I was king
I was king
If I go down
I will go down fighting
I'll go down
Down like lightning
If I go down
I will go down fighting
I'll go down
Down like lightning
If I go down
I will go down fighting
I'll go down
Down like lightning
I was king
When am I when am I
Gonna start living
When am I when am I
Gonna move on
When am I when am I
Gonna kill this feeling
When am I when am I
Gonna stop this dreaming
When I was king
I was king
I was king
When I was king
I was king
We had everything
When am I when am I
Gonna start living
Yeah I was king
